# Web Application Development Prototype Submission

## Overview
This prototype submission demonstrates the development of an e-commerce web application, focusing on frontend and backend functionalities, database management, integration, and deployment. The submission includes explanations and reasoning for each task completed.

### Project Details
- **Project Title:** E-commerce Site Development Prototype
- **Submission Date:** [Date of Submission]

## Task 1: Frontend Development
The frontend was developed using the React.js framework to create a customer-facing interface for browsing artifacts and curios. Key functionalities implemented include:
1. Displaying artifacts and curios with relevant details such as name, description, and price.
2. Implementing search and filter functionalities for easy navigation through the product catalog.
3. Designing the interface with responsiveness to ensure optimal viewing across various devices.

## Task 2: Backend Development
Backend functionalities were implemented using Django Rest Framework to handle user authentication and authorization. APIs were developed for:
1. User registration and authentication, including password hashing for security.
2. Authorization checks to restrict access to merchant-specific features.
3. Security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Task 3: Database Management
A relational database schema was designed using PostgreSQL to store user data, product information, and transaction records. Key aspects considered include:
1. Tables/entities for users, products, orders, and services.
2. Appropriate relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) between entities.
3. Ensuring data integrity and implementing mechanisms for scalability.

## Task 4: Integration and Deployment
Frontend and backend components were integrated into a cohesive web application. Deployment was carried out using PythonAnywhere for the backend and Vercel for the frontend. The deployment process included:
1. Testing methodologies to ensure functionality and performance.
2. Utilization of PythonAnywhere and Vercel platforms for deployment.
3. Measures for scalability, reliability, and security post-deployment.

## Task 5: Additional Considerations
Identified potential challenges or risks were addressed, including strategies to mitigate them for successful project completion.
